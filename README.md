## Industry/Domain
This project is situated in the **personal auto insurance industry**, focusing on portfolio segmentation and risk analysis.

## Dataset Description and Source
The dataset contains over 120,000 auto insurance policy records with 301 features, including insured value, premium, vehicle specifications, and claim outcomes.

Data source: [Vehicle Insurance Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/vehicle-insurance-data/data) by Edossa Terefe.

## Summary of Findings
K-means clustering revealed two distinct segments within the portfolio. Cluster 0 represents lower-value, lower-premium policies with older vehicles, while Cluster 1 captures higher-value, higher-premium policies with newer vehicles. The segmentation partially aligns with claim outcomes: Cluster 1 shows more than double the proportion of costly claims compared to Cluster 0, highlighting meaningful risk differentiation and business value for underwriting and reserve planning.
